          <h2>The Hameed Family</h2>
          <p>Our father, Abdul Hameed, was born in a once remote village of Gurutalawa, amidst the hills of Uva.</p>
          <p>He married our mother, Rahumani Umma, in 1928 and soon became the patriarch of a large family of 12 children: six boys and six girls.</p>
          <p>Education became the focal point of the life they created for us.</p>
          <p>Our parents not only ensured that we received the best education&nbsp;available,but also encouraged the elders and decision makers of the village to educate every child in Gurutalawa.</p>
          <p>Together, my mother and father built the foundation for the educational infrastructure in the village.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-12">
          <p>What they pioneered enabled Gurutalawa to attract teachers from other towns and provided their accommodation. We believe expanding the boundaries of learning for students in need is pivotal for our townâ€™s success.</p>
          <p>As we grew older, my brothers, sisters, I and broke ground on our own projects to ensure that students are now individually supported. Before long, it was clear that we could better serve underprivileged students as a collective family to provide greater opportunities and resources with more impact. Throughout everything, what governed my family and our town was the dedication of my parents.</p>
          <p>The Hameed Foundation was established in 2016, named after our parents as a tribute to their unyielding efforts to provide for our family, provide for our village, and provide students with the knowledge to forge their own future.</p>
